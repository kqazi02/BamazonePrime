This app shows the user a list of products in a store(database), and lets the user enter the id of the product and the quantity they want to buy. Once the user enters the input, the app checks the database for whether the quantity of product user specifies is available. If so, the app updates the database, prints out the total price, and exits the app 

If the database does not have enough quantity of product, as specified by the user, then the app tells the user that the quantity is not available, and exits the app.
